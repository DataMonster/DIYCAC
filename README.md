DIYCAC is main website for business, access prod url: www.diycac.cn.

Main tech stack is HTML5/CSS3, JQuery and NodeJS. Use gulp to build and deploy through github.

### Tech

DIYCAC uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [HTML/CSS] - everything basic for web apps!
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [jQuery] - so be it.
* [Node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework
* [WebStorm] - IDE for development.

Besides, Google fonts and other template CSS are embedded in the project so we don't need to download from.
